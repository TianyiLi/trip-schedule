## Deployment

## Architecture

The project follows a feature module architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Feature Modules**: Each feature (`home`, `trip-planning`, `navigation`, `archive`, `settings`) is self-contained
- **Shared Resources**: Common components, contexts, and utilities in `src/shared/`
- **Page â†’ Container â†’ View Pattern**: Clean separation between routing, business logic, and presentation
